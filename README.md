# Boston_Housing

Today, we aim to utilize regression models to predict house prices in Boston using a dataset obtained from this link: [Kaggle Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schirmerchad/bostonhoustingmlnd). The target variable in this dataset is the house prices.

As a result, the Random Forest regression performed the best of all with an R-squared value of 0.8484.
